# Easing for UI Animations and a bit more...

## Description

This program shows 3 examples of how Easing can be applied in many areas of a project in order to give life to movements and actions and enhance UX.

## Key Features

 ### Example 1
 
 The screen shows an image made out of boxes with letters and a square filling one of the boxes. Use the letters to move horizontally through all the boxes.
 You can also change the Easing Mode and the time that it takes to do the next animation.
 
 ### Example 2
 
 Here you will se a small environment with grass, a sign and a tree. Move inside the sign to move the camera towards the tree. Step out to make the camera return.
 
 ### Example 3 :)
 
 A mithical character shows up!
 
 This example shows how easing can be used for images and all the ways you can play with them.
 
 The horizontal bars show the progress of the tweening more visually. Use the letters next to the bars to toggle on/off a certain behavior.
 
 Have fun!
