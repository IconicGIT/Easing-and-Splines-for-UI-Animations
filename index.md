# Easing and Splines for UI Animations

The UI of a game is one of the the most important parts that can influence the User Experience for our players. It is also an element that appears almost in every part of our game, from the start of the game, while in the middle of gameplay, to its final scene.

That's the main reason why it is a good idea to improve the UX in our game, starting by the UI!

By using Easing Functions and Splines you can easily give life to the movements and animations of your UI.

## What are those _Easing Functions_ and _Splines_?

### About _Easing Functions_:

As redundant as it may sound, _Easing functions_ are _functions_ that let us control the "speed" of a certain movement within a certain time and duration:

### Splines

A spline is a line controlled by a what are called <b>control points</b>, and its shape follows their position by interpolating from one point to another using polynomials.

There are many advanced mathematics involvesd in making these ([paper explaining](URL 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)'))

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/IconicGIT/Easing-and-Splines-for-UI-Animations/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
